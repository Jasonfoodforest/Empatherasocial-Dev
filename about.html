  <h1>About EmpathEra</h1>
  <p>
    EmpathEra is a new kind of social experience—one built around compassion, awareness,
    and unity. We believe that empathy is not just an emotion but a technology, a value system, 
    and a foundation for building a better world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through creative media, meaningful conversations, and a growing community,
    we’re building a place where people are heard, where actions align with values,
    and where the future is co-created with purpose and love.
  </p>
  <p>
    Join us as we shape a world powered by connection, kindness, and shared humanity.
